For example source is the player id and we want to check their time played on the server. We will run the export in our function like this:
local playtime = exports.Prefech_PlayTime:getPlayTime(source) Now the variable playtime will be a table. The table will include both the session and total playtime.
Session time in the table is named Session Total playtime in the table is named Total The table returns the Total and Session playtime in seconds.</description></item><item><title>No Player Export</title><link>https://docs.prefech.com/jd_logs/hide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.prefech.com/jd_logs/hide/</guid><description>Using the export with no player details!
Since we’re not using player_id and player_2_id we have removed them from the export.
Example: (/tweet [Message]) RegisterCommand(&amp;#34;tweet&amp;#34;, function(source, args, rawCommand) TriggerClientEvent(&amp;#39;chatMessage&amp;#39;, -1, &amp;#34;Tweet | &amp;#34; .. GetPlayerName(source)..&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;..rawCommand:gsub(&amp;#34;tweet &amp;#34;, &amp;#34;&amp;#34;), { 201, 201, 201 }) exports.JD_logs:createLog({ EmbedMessage = &amp;#34;Tweet | &amp;#34; .. GetPlayerName(source)..&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;..rawCommand:gsub(&amp;#34;tweet &amp;#34;, &amp;#34;&amp;#34;), color = &amp;#34;#FFFFFF&amp;#34;, channel = &amp;#34;tweet&amp;#34;, screenshot = false }) end) EmbedMessage: This will be the /tweet message in this case player_id: Since there is no players we have removed it player_2_id: Since there is no players we have removed it color: This can be any color you want channel: This will be linked to the webhook in the config.</description></item><item><title>One Player Export</title><link>https://docs.prefech.com/jd_logs/single/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.prefech.com/jd_logs/single/</guid><description>Using the export for one player!
player_id: is the variable that is used for getting the player info. player_2_id: isn&amp;rsquo;t used and therefore we can remove it from the export. for server-side resources player_id will be source on client-side this will be GetPlayerServerId(PlayerId())
Keep in mind these might also change depending on the framework
Example: (/me [Message]) RegisterCommand(&amp;#34;me&amp;#34;, function(source, args, rawCommand) TriggerClientEvent(&amp;#39;chatMessage&amp;#39;, -1, &amp;#34;ME | &amp;#34; ..

player_id: is the variable that is used for getting the player info. player_2_id: this will be the server id of the second player to get their info. player_2_id will be a server variable that is the server id of the second player
Keep in mind these might also change depending on the framework
Example: (/mention [PlayerID]) RegisterCommand(&amp;#34;mention&amp;#34;, function(source, args, rawCommand) TriggerClientEvent(&amp;#39;chatMessage&amp;#39;, -1, &amp;#34;Mention | &amp;#34; .</description></item><item><title>Embeds</title><link>https://docs.prefech.com/jd_logs/embeds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.prefech.com/jd_logs/embeds/</guid><description> Embeds can be disabled in the webhooks.json
Just set the embed to false and you won’t get a ambed build.
If you disabled embeds the export will output the EmbedMessage as a normal message.
If you disable embeds on a channel you will NOT be able to include player details or screenshots.</description></item></channel></rss>
