For example source is the player id and we want to check their time played on the server. We will run the export in our function like this:\nlocal playtime = exports.Prefech_PlayTime:getPlayTime(source) Now the variable playtime will be a table. The table will include both the session and total playtime.\n Session time in the table is named Session Total playtime in the table is named Total  The table returns the Total and Session playtime in seconds.\nTo get the playtime you simply have to grab the value from the table and check if it has been at least 5 minutes since they connected.\nif playtime.Session \u0026gt;= 300 then print(\u0026#39;They have been online for 5 minutes or longer\u0026#39;) else print(\u0026#39;They have been online less than 5 minutes\u0026#39;) end Now i used 300 since that is 5 minutes in seconds. The export returns the playtime in seconds so you can convert it to minutes or hours.\nNow to put it together our code will look like this:\nlocal playtime = exports.Prefech_PlayTime:getPlayTime(source) if playtime.Session \u0026gt;= 300 then print(\u0026#39;They have been online for 5 minutes or longer\u0026#39;) else print(\u0026#39;They have been online less than 5 minutes\u0026#39;) end Usage Examples Client side total playtime example RegisterNetEvent(\u0026#39;PlayTimeCheck\u0026#39;) AddEventHandler(\u0026#39;PlayTimeCheck\u0026#39;, function() if exports.Prefech_PlayTime:getPlayTime(GetPlayerServerId(PlayerId())).Total \u0026gt;= 600 then return true else return false end end) Server side total playtime example RegisterNetEvent(\u0026#39;PlayTimeCheck\u0026#39;) AddEventHandler(\u0026#39;PlayTimeCheck\u0026#39;, function() if exports.Prefech_PlayTime:getPlayTime(source).Total \u0026gt;= 600 then return true else return false end end) Client side session playtime example RegisterNetEvent(\u0026#39;PlayTimeCheck\u0026#39;) AddEventHandler(\u0026#39;PlayTimeCheck\u0026#39;, function() if exports.Prefech_PlayTime:getPlayTime(GetPlayerServerId(PlayerId())).Session \u0026gt;= 600 then return true else return false end end) Server side session playtime example RegisterNetEvent(\u0026#39;PlayTimeCheck\u0026#39;) AddEventHandler(\u0026#39;PlayTimeCheck\u0026#39;, function() if exports.Prefech_PlayTime:getPlayTime(source).Session \u0026gt;= 600 then return true else return false end end) "},{"uri":"https://docs.prefech.com/jd_logs/hide/","title":"No Player Export","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Using the export with no player details!\nSince we’re not using player_id and player_2_id we have removed them from the export.\n Example: (/tweet [Message]) RegisterCommand(\u0026#34;tweet\u0026#34;, function(source, args, rawCommand) TriggerClientEvent(\u0026#39;chatMessage\u0026#39;, -1, \u0026#34;Tweet | \u0026#34; ..
