> Want to keep your discord clean the same way as your server?  
> You can now sync Global bans with your discord!  
> Our goal is to not only keep your server clean of hackers but also your discord!  

![check](https://prefech.com/i/check.png)
> Want to know is someone is on the global ban list?  
> You can use the /check command to see if they are banned!  
> You can use the command with any identifier with or without prefix!  
> The bot will find the ban linked to the identifier if there is one and give you the ban reason.  
>   
> **Example:**  
> You can use `discord:1234567891234567891`  
> But you can also use `1234567891234567891`
