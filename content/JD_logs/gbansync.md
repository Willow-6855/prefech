> Want to keep your discord clean the same way as your server?  
> You can now sync Global bans with your discord!  
> Our goal is to not only keep your server clean of hackers but also your discord!  
  
![kickban](https://prefech.com/i/kickban.png)
> You can decide yourself if you want to kick them off your discord or just ban them.  
> Use the command /banuser to change the setting.  
> By default the bot will only kick global banned players from your discord.  

![check](https://prefech.com/i/check.png)
> Want to know is someone is on the global ban list?  
> You can use the /check command to see if they are banned!  
> You can use the command with any identifier with or without prefix!  
> The bot will find the ban linked to the identifier if there is one and give you the ban reason.  
>   
> **Example:**  
> You can use `discord:1234567891234567891`  
> But you can also use `1234567891234567891`

> **Commands:**

> `/bypass`: Allow a discord id to bypass the global bans. (This will prevent them from being kicked/banned)  
> `/banuser`: This will allow you to toggle the kick to a ban function and the other way around.  
> `/check`: Check if the given identifier is global banned.  
> `/invite`: Get an invite to get the bot in another discord!  
> `/ping`: Ping the bot to see if it's online.
