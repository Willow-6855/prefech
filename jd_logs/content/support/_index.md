## Help it doesn't work!

If you've looked _everywhere_ on here, and still can't figure it out, then post something on the [<i class='fab fa-fw fab fa-discourse'></i> forum topic](https://forum.fivem.net/t/vmenu-v1-1-5-a-server-sided-menu-including-almost-full-permissions-support/88868?u=vespura). **Note however that vMenu is no longer being supported so I will probably no longer reply, only community members might be able to help you.**

{{% notice warning %}}
I will **IGNORE** any questions or issues that have already been mentioned/reported here or on the [<i class='fa fa-github'></i> GitHub](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu/) issues page. If you find a bug, please create an issue on the GitHub repo page. Do make sure that it is actually a _BUG_. If you "just" can't figure it out and you create an issue, it will be deleted and I will block you from making new issues on the GitHub repository and report it as spam.
<br><br>If you're not sure wether or not it's actually a bug, or an intended feature, or you're just setting it up wrong, then feel free to contact me before creating an issue on GitHub.

{{% notice note%}}
When creating a bug report or asking for support, please provide as _much_ information as possible. Starting with a full client & server log (especially for bugs or whenever errors occur). Also provide your permissions.cfg file if you have a question/issue related to permissions.
<br>**Without these files I won't be able to help you.**

*Also make sure to checkout the [F.A.Q.](/vmenu/faq/) page before asking a FAQ question, because this will result in you getting flamed for your stupidity.*
